# kaggle_notebooks
I began my data science journey with Kaggle competitions and then took a break from working on them for a while
to focus on building projects with real world data, but now I have a bit more time and thought it would be fun
to start working on some Kaggle competitions again. Decided to start with the classic Housing Price as that was 
my first ML project. I was happy to see my work in the last year paid off as my score jumped from the top 20% 
to the top 1% with a fairly simple model architecture.
